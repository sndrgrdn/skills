## Content patterns

### 1. Undue emphasis on significance, legacy, and broader trends

**Signal words:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain. This initiative was part of a broader movement across Spain to decentralize administrative functions and enhance regional governance.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics independently from Spain's national statistics office.


### 2. Undue emphasis on notability and media coverage

**Signal words:** independent coverage, local/regional/national media outlets, written by a leading expert, active social media presence

**Problem:** LLMs hit readers over the head with claims of notability, often listing sources without context.

Newer AI tools (2025+) may echo the exact wording of platform guidelines (e.g., "independent coverage") and may create entire sections asserting notability via source lists. A common tell is noting that a subject "maintains an active social media presence" — phrasing that is rare in human writing pre-2024.

**Before:**
> Her views have been cited in The New York Times, BBC, Financial Times, and The Hindu. She maintains an active social media presence with over 500,000 followers.

**After:**
> In a 2024 New York Times interview, she argued that AI regulation should focus on outcomes rather than methods.


### 3. Superficial analyses with -ing endings

**Signal words:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing..., align/resonate with

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth. Newer chatbots with retrieval-augmented generation may attach these statements to named sources regardless of whether those sources say anything close.

**Before:**
> The temple's color palette of blue, green, and gold resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, the Gulf of Mexico, and the diverse Texan landscapes, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.

**After:**
> The temple uses blue, green, and gold colors. The architect said these were chosen to reference local bluebonnets and the Gulf coast.


### 4. Promotional and advertisement-like language

**Signal words:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Problem:** LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone, especially for "cultural heritage" topics.

Note: Older LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) tend to output more blatantly positive text than newer LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-5), which are more likely to be **subtly** positive — still promotional, but harder to catch at a glance.

**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage and stunning natural beauty.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church.


### 5. Vague attributions and weasel words

**Signal words:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)

**Problem:** AI chatbots attribute opinions to vague authorities without specific sources.

LLMs also exaggerate the quantity of sources: they present views from one or two sources as widely held, mention multiple "reviewers" or "scholars" while citing only one, or imply lists are non-exhaustive when sources give no such indication.

**Before:**
> Due to its unique characteristics, the Haolai River is of interest to researchers and conservationists. Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> The Haolai River supports several endemic fish species, according to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences.


### 6. Outline-like "Challenges and Future Prospects" sections

**Signal words:** Despite its... faces several challenges..., Despite these challenges, Challenges and Legacy, Future Outlook

**Problem:** Many LLM-generated articles include formulaic "Challenges" sections.

**Before:**
> Despite its industrial prosperity, Korattur faces challenges typical of urban areas, including traffic congestion and water scarcity. Despite these challenges, with its strategic location and ongoing initiatives, Korattur continues to thrive as an integral part of Chennai's growth.

**After:**
> Traffic congestion increased after 2015 when three new IT parks opened. The municipal corporation began a stormwater drainage project in 2022 to address recurring floods.

## Language and grammar patterns

### 7. Overused "AI vocabulary" words

**High-frequency AI words:** Actually, additionally, align with, bolstered, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), meticulous/meticulously, pivotal, robust, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

The distribution shifts by model era:

| Era | Characteristic words |
|-----|---------------------|
| 2023–mid 2024 (GPT-4) | Additionally, boasts, bolstered, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, garner, intricate/intricacies, interplay, key, landscape, meticulous/meticulously, pivotal, underscore, tapestry, testament, valuable, vibrant |
| Mid 2024–mid 2025 (GPT-4o) | align with, bolstered, crucial, emphasizing, enhance, enduring, fostering, highlighting, pivotal, showcasing, underscore, vibrant |
| Mid 2025+ (GPT-5) | emphasizing, enhance, highlighting, showcasing (plus notability/significance inflation phrases) |

One or two of these appearing may be coincidence. A cluster of them in the same passage is one of the strongest tells. Note: `delve` was famously overused by ChatGPT in 2023–early 2024, became less frequent later in 2024, then dropped off sharply in 2025.

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur.

**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature of Somali cuisine is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta in the local culinary landscape, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.


### 8. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (copula avoidance)

**Signal words:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/maintains/offers [a], refers to

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space for contemporary art. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.


### 9. Negative parallelisms and tailing negations

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused. Two subtypes:
- **"Not just X, but also Y"**: Clearing up an imaginary misconception — "It's not just about the beat; it's about unlocking creativity at scale."
- **"Not X, but Y"**: Explicitly denying a characteristic — "This is not a mirror but a portal: not a representation of self, but a mechanism for reinvention." Also appears as clipped fragments: "no guessing", "no wasted motion."

**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere. It's not merely a song, it's a statement.

**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.

**Before (tailing negation):**
> The options come from the selected item, no guessing.

**After:**
> The options come from the selected item without forcing the user to guess.


### 10. Rule of three overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.


### 11. Elegant variation (synonym cycling)

**Problem:** AI has repetition-penalty code causing excessive synonym substitution.

**Before:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges. The main character must overcome obstacles. The central figure eventually triumphs. The hero returns home.

**After:**
> The protagonist faces many challenges but eventually triumphs and returns home.


### 12. False ranges

**Problem:** LLMs use "from X to Y" constructions where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale.

**Before:**
> Our journey through the universe has taken us from the singularity of the Big Bang to the grand cosmic web, from the birth and death of stars to the enigmatic dance of dark matter.

**After:**
> The book covers the Big Bang, star formation, and current theories about dark matter.


### 13. Passive voice and subjectless fragments

**Problem:** LLMs often hide the actor or drop the subject entirely with lines like "No configuration file needed" or "The results are preserved automatically." Rewrite when active voice makes the sentence clearer and more direct.

**Before:**
> No configuration file needed. The results are preserved automatically.

**After:**
> You do not need a configuration file. The system preserves the results automatically.


---

## Style patterns

### 14. Em dash overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes (—) more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing. Most can be rewritten with commas, periods, or parentheses.

**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.

**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.


### 15. Overuse of boldface

**Problem:** AI chatbots emphasize phrases in boldface mechanically.

**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.

**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.


### 16. Inline-header vertical lists

**Problem:** AI outputs lists where items start with bolded headers followed by colons.

**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.

**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.


### 17. Title case in headings

**Problem:** AI chatbots capitalize all main words in headings.

**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships

**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships


### 18. Emojis

**Problem:** AI chatbots often decorate headings or bullet points with emojis.

**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting

**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.


### 19. Curly quotation marks

**Problem:** ChatGPT uses curly quotes ("\u2026") instead of straight quotes ("...").

**Before:**
> He said \u201cthe project is on track\u201d but others disagreed.

**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.


---

## Communication patterns

### 20. Collaborative communication artifacts

**Signal words:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., let me know, here is a...

**Problem:** Text meant as chatbot correspondence gets pasted as content.

**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.

**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.


### 21. Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers

**Signal words:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information...

**Problem:** AI disclaimers about incomplete information get left in text.

**Before:**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.

**After:**
> The company was founded in 1994, according to its registration documents.


### 22. Sycophantic/servile tone

**Problem:** Overly positive, people-pleasing language.

**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.

**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.


---

## Filler, hedging, and rhetoric

### 23. Filler phrases

Common substitutions:

| Filler | Replacement |
|--------|-------------|
| In order to achieve this goal | To achieve this |
| Due to the fact that | Because |
| At this point in time | Now |
| In the event that | If |
| has the ability to | can |
| It is important to note that X | X |


### 24. Excessive hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.


### 25. Generic positive conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.

**After:**
> The company plans to open two more locations next year.


### 26. Hyphenated word pair overuse

**Signal words:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end

**Problem:** AI hyphenates common word pairs with perfect consistency. Humans rarely hyphenate these uniformly. Less common or technical compound modifiers are fine to hyphenate.

**Before:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report on our client-facing tools. Their decision-making process was well-known for being thorough and detail-oriented.

**After:**
> The cross functional team delivered a high quality, data driven report on our client facing tools. Their decision making process was known for being thorough and detail oriented.


### 27. Persuasive authority tropes

**Signal words:** The real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter

**Problem:** LLMs use these phrases to pretend they are cutting through noise to some deeper truth, when the sentence that follows usually just restates an ordinary point with extra ceremony.

**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.

**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt. That mostly depends on whether the organization is ready to change its habits.


### 28. Signposting and announcements

**Signal words:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado

**Problem:** LLMs announce what they are about to do instead of doing it. This meta-commentary slows the writing down and gives it a tutorial-script feel.

**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.

**After:**
> Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.


### 29. Fragmented headers

**Problem:** LLMs often add a generic sentence after a heading as a rhetorical warm-up. It usually adds nothing and makes the prose feel padded.

**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.


---

## Output and formatting artifacts

### 30. Unnecessary tables

**Problem:** AI creates small tables where a sentence or two of prose would be clearer and more natural. The tables often have only 2–3 rows and add no structure that prose couldn't handle.

**Before:**
> | Feature | Status |
> |---------|--------|
> | Dark mode | Available |
> | Export to PDF | Coming Q3 |
> | API access | Beta |

**After:**
> Dark mode is available now. PDF export is coming in Q3, and API access is in beta.


### 31. Markdown formatting artifacts

**Problem:** LLMs default to Markdown output (bold with `**`, headers with `##`, lists with `-`, code fences with triple backticks). When text is pasted into emails, docs, wikis, or other non-Markdown contexts, the raw syntax leaks through. Even when rendered, the mechanical Markdown structure (rigid heading hierarchy, uniform list formatting) is a tell.

**Signal artifacts:** `**bold**` for emphasis, `## Header` for sections, `- ` bullet lists, triple-backtick code fences, `[text](url)` link syntax, `---` thematic breaks before headings.

**Before:**
> ## Key Takeaways
>
> - **Performance**: The new build is **2x faster** than the previous version.
> - **Reliability**: Error rates have been **reduced by 40%**.
>
> ---
>
> ## Next Steps

**After:**
> The new build is about twice as fast and cut error rates by 40%. Next we need to...

In order to fully realize this potential, teams must align with best practices.
>
> In conclusion, the future looks bright. Exciting times lie ahead as we continue this journey toward excellence. Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section!

### Draft rewrite:

> AI coding assistants speed up some tasks. In a 2024 study by Google, developers using Codex completed simple functions 55% faster than a control group, but showed no improvement on debugging or architectural decisions.
>
> The tools are good at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They are bad at knowing when they are wrong. I have mass-accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still did the wrong thing because I stopped paying attention.
>
> Mira, an engineer at a fintech startup I interviewed, said she uses Copilot "like autocomplete for boring code" but reviews every line before committing. Jake, a senior dev at a larger company, disabled it after it kept suggesting patterns from a deprecated internal library.
>
> The productivity claims are hard to verify. GitHub says Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance is not correctness, and correctness is not value. The 2024 Uplevel study found no statistically significant difference in pull-request throughput between teams with and without AI assistants.
>
> None of this means the tools are useless. It means they are tools. They do not replace judgment, and they do not eliminate the need for tests. If you do not have tests, you cannot tell whether the suggestion is right.

### Anti-AI audit:

- The rhythm is still a bit too tidy (clean contrasts, evenly paced paragraphs).
- The named people and study citations can read like plausible-but-made-up placeholders unless they're real and sourced.
- The closer leans a touch slogan-y ("If you do not have tests...") rather than sounding like a person talking.

### Final rewrite:

> AI coding assistants can make you faster at the boring parts. Not everything. Definitely not architecture.
>
> They're great at boilerplate: config files, test scaffolding, repetitive refactors. They're also great at sounding right while being wrong. I've accepted suggestions that compiled, passed lint, and still missed the point because I stopped paying attention.
>
> People I talk to tend to land in two camps. Some use it like autocomplete for chores and review every line. Others disable it after it keeps suggesting patterns they don't want. Both feel reasonable.
>
> The productivity metrics are slippery. GitHub can say Copilot users "accept 30% of suggestions," but acceptance isn't correctness, and correctness isn't value. If you don't have tests, you're basically guessing.
