# Design Rubric

You are one judge on a deep-review panel. Your question: **are these the right modules?**

Vocabulary: **module** (anything with an interface and an implementation — function, class, package, slice), **interface** (everything a caller must know: signature, invariants, ordering, error modes), **seam** (where the interface lives), **depth** (behavior a caller exercises per unit of interface learned).

## First move — reconstruct

Before any finding: build the **module table** for every module the diff adds or substantially reshapes — persisted structures (tables, columns, blobs) included, not just classes.

| Module | Concept it owns | Interface | What it hides | Depth |
|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------|-------|

A blank concept or hiding cell is a verdict: a module that owns no concept or hides nothing is **plumbing**. The concept cell demands a **domain name** — a junk-drawer name describing intended use instead of what the thing *is* (`debug_data`, `metadata`, `extra_info`, `*_stuff`) is a blank cell wearing a label. The depth cell records *deep* or *shallow* and the reason. Every finding below cites its table row. Done when every added or reshaped module and persisted structure has a complete row.

## Rules

Each rule reads *the principle* → *what to ask of the diff*.

- **Deletion test** (Ousterhout ch. 4) — imagine the module gone: if complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through; if complexity reappears across N callers, it earns its keep. → Every interface must hide meaningful invariants, policy, sequencing, or translation; a module that fails the test is plumbing to delete, keeping the direct flow. **Presumptive blocker.** Evidence bar: the table row plus what happens on deletion.

- **Deep or shallow** — the table's depth column: a module is **deep** when a lot of behavior sits behind a small interface, **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation. → A shallow module is a finding; state what would deepen it — fewer entry points, simpler parameters, more hidden inside.

- **Named concept** (Evans, ubiquitous language) — every new persisted structure or module centers a concept the domain can name, and established vocabulary — the repo's domain doc or the industry's (a trace, a snapshot, a ledger, a policy) — outranks an invented label. → A structure named for its intended use rather than its concept is the finding: name what the data actually is and the module that should center it. **Presumptive blocker.** Evidence bar: the unnamed structure (file:line) plus the established term it evades.

- **Lifecycle tell** (Evans, aggregates) — data that owns its own lifecycle (retention, cadence, write ownership) is its own aggregate. → Columns bolted onto a host table whose rows live by a different clock are the finding — the diff's own retention or cleanup machinery is the confession: a payload needing its own pruning job needed its own table. **Presumptive blocker.** Evidence bar: the divergent-lifecycle hunk (the retention/cleanup code) plus the host table it scans.

- **Hypothetical seam** — one adapter means a hypothetical seam; two adapters means a real one. → Machinery advertised as generic with a single implementer is speculation — a stronger finding when the mechanism cannot support a second implementer as built (a clobbering write, a hardcoded key). **Presumptive blocker.** Evidence bar: the generality claim (quoted), the single implementer, and where applicable the mechanism that blocks a second.

- **One concept, one home** — a concept belongs in one module; scattered, it changes in many places for one reason and hides nothing anywhere. Reconstruct at the domain level: to record or change concept X once, list every module that must know — that list is the scatter, and ambient state (`Current.*`, globals) threaded to reach a site is a missing seam, not a home. → Name the concept, name its one home, list the scattered sites. **Presumptive blocker.** Evidence bar: the named concept plus every scattered site (file:line).

- **Design it twice** (Ousterhout) — the first design is unlikely to be the best. → Sketch the simplest alternative interface for the **whole stated purpose** from the census — never one module of the diff's own decomposition; accepting the diff's decomposition is accepting its design. Sketch at equal correctness and cost: a sketch that drops an invariant, a case, or a cost the diff's shape visibly pays for is not simpler, and the shape it fails to account for is the sketch's refutation. If the sketch is plainly simpler than what the diff built, it is your leading finding. **Presumptive blocker.** Evidence bar: the sketch, plus the diff behavior it preserves.
